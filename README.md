# Matching Cards Game - Frontend
This project is a part of my participation in SE Factory Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The project is a matching cards game (memory game) only using frontend languages

# About the Game
This game is made of 6 cards, everytime the user reloads the website the images shuffles containing 3 matches( 3 porgramming languages logo).
If the user guesses the two matching images, his score will be incremented by 1, but if he messed his score will be decremented by -2.
There is a title that shows the current score of the user (min:0 - max: not limited)
Underneath the title 'Restart button' which reshuffle, and reshow previous matching images, to let the user continue his fun journey.
